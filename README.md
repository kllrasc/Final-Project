# Final-Project
Final Project for MSCH-C220 December 2, 2023


## Theme

I interpreted the theme as transitioning from inside one space to another.

Move the space ship to shoot bullets at the planets.

## Game Play
The objective is to avoid or kill the other planets with bullets from your ship within the time range given.

## Impediments 
Connecting all of the scenes and variables together to make sure that every part connected together fluidly was the biggest obstacle.


## Implementation

Built using Godot 4.1.1
